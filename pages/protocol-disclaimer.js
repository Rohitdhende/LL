              <p>
                This disclaimer relates to the use of the Liquid Loans Protocol
                Software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please read this disclaimer carefully before accessing,
                interacting with, or using the Liquid Loans Protocol Software.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Liquid Loans Protocol Software consists of the Liquid Loans
                Protocol technology stack (in particular its smart contracts),
                as well as any other Liquid Loans technology (together the
                “Liquid Loans Protocol Software”).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Liquid Loans Protocol Software enables its users (“User”) to
                create interest-free liquidity in USDL (a USD pegged stablecoin)
                by depositing PLS towards autonomous smart contracts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The USDL is stabilized by a liquidation mechanism and a
                Stability Pool which both are fully decentralized and smart
                contract based as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the use of the functions of the Liquid Loans Protocol
                Software, the involved smart contracts automatically and
                autonomously deduct technical fees which can be claimed by the
                LOAN holders (if any).
              </p>
              <p>
                Any and all functionalities of the Liquid Loans Protocol
                Software are of purely technical nature and there is no claim
                towards any private individual or legal entity in this regard.

              </h1>
              <p>
                The Liquid Loans Protocol Software runs in a fully decentralized

                factual relationships between Users and the smart contracts of
                the Liquid Loans Protocol Software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Liquid Loans (Australia) Pty Ltd. has neither access to nor any

                transactions, deposits and/or allocations made by the Users and
                the involved smart contracts using the Liquid Loans Protocol
                Software.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, Liquid Loans (Australia) Pty Ltd. has not and

              <p>
                THE LIQUID LOANS PROTOCOL SOFTWARE IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND
                ANY REAL PLS AND/OR USDL AND/OR LOAN SENT, STAKED OR DEPOSITED
                TO THE LIQUID LOANS PROTOCOL SOFTWARE ARE AT RISK OF BEING LOST

              </p>
              <p>
                There are no official frontend operators, and the use of any
                frontend is made by User at its own risk. To assess the
                trustworthiness of a frontend operator lies in the sole
                responsibility of the User and must be made carefully.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, as the Liquid Loans Protocol Software is built on the
                PulseChain network its proper functioning is dependent on the
                PulseChain network and any transaction including USDL or LOAN
                requires PLS as gas.

                Assumption of Risks of Cryptographic Token, Currencies and

              </h1>
              <p>
                There are also general risks associated with purchasing, owning
                and using cryptographic Token (hereinafter “Token”) In order to
                access and make use of certain features of the Liquid Loans
                Protocol Software, a User may need Token (in particular, PLS,
                USDL and/or LOAN).{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                Token such as PLS, USDL and LOAN are highly volatile due to many
                factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation,
                technology, and security risks. The cost of transacting on the
                PulseChain network or related blockchain technologies is
                variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any
                activities taking place on the PulseChain network.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                User is solely responsible for transacting and holding Token
                like PLS, USDL and/or LOAN while accessing and/or interacting
                with the Liquid Loans Protocol Software.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                Neither USDL nor LOAN do represent or constitute any ownership
                rights or stake, shares or security or equivalent rights nor any
                rights to receive future revenues or shares or any other form of
                participation or governance rights in or relating to any private
                individual or legal entity.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, both USDL and LOAN do not represent or confer any
                ownership right or stake, share, security, or equivalent rights,
                or any right to receive future revenue shares, intellectual
                property rights or any other form of participation in or
                relating to any private individual or legal entity.{' '}
              </p>
              <p>
                User is responsible for implementing reasonable measures for
                securing the wallet, vault or other storage mechanism used to
                receive and hold PLS, USDL and LOAN or any other Token,
                including any requisite private key(s) or other credentials
                necessary to access such storage mechanism(s). If User’s private
                key(s) or other access credentials are lost, User may lose
                access to its Token.{' '}

                The Liquid Loans Protocol Software could be impacted by one or
                more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could
                impede or limit User’s ability to access or use the Liquid Loans
